### Remember

Answer these on your own, then compare answers as a group

1.  What is state? Data that is held and can be referred back to.

2.  Where do you set initial state? Within a constructor.

3.  What method do you use to update state? "this.setState"

### Understand

Discuss this question in pairs if you have a 4-person group

4.  Explain what's happening in this component. State is assigned to the "questions answered" information. This component takes questions answered and increases it by one each time the user clicks the button.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class LeadMentor extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      questionsAnswered: 0
    };

    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({ questionsAnswered: this.state.questionsAnswered + 1 });
  }
  render() {
    <div className="lead-mentor-container">
      <h1>Michael Scott</h1>
      <h3>{this.state.questionsAnswered}</h3>
      <h3>questions answered today</h3>
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increase Answers</button>
    </div>;
  }
}
```

### Apply

Try these on your own, but work together if you start to get stuck.

5.  Create a `Student` component that keeps track of the number of questions the student has asked, with a button that adds 1 to the total when it's clicked



6.  Now add a text input where the student can type in their questions with a button to add them to a list of questions that is displayed below the number of questions asked.

### Analyze, Evaluate, Create

Discuss these questions as a group

7.  Could your `Student` component be refactored into a functional component? Why or why not?

8.  What are the pros and cons of using a class method for an event handler vs. using an arrow function inline?

9.  The render() method is called every time a component's state is updated. For a text input, that means the render method is called for every keypress. Why isn't this bad for performance?
